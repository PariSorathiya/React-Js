//Component -> Component is a re-usable piece of code returns a part of ui.

// There are two type of component.
//Functional Component ------- class Component.

// Functional Component -> When we write a simple java script function in a component and it return some value.

// Class Component -> When we write es6 classes(oops) in a component.

// module -> these are user define files or block of code which we can import and export.

// JSX -> Javascript XML -> It allows us to write html with javascript together.{}


* Class Component:-
- When we write ES6 classes (oops) in a Component.
-Class component have all the feature of react js like state, props, life cycle methods and all but functional component does not have those initially.

-In react 16.8 hooks were introduced which all the features of react in functional component.



* There are three life cycle stages in react js:-

-Mounting -> Creation of component

-Updating -> updation of component

-Unmounting -> deletion/Completion of component


*Life cycle method in Class Component
- componentDidMount()
- componentDidUpdate()
- componentWillUnmount()


* Life cycle methods in Functional component:

-There is a hook called useEffect()

* State in React:-
-In React "State" refers to a java script object that holds data specific to a component, which can change over time and influence the component's rendering.
-When we have to access state in class component then -> this.state


-> first time load this is called rendering phase.
-> reload the page this called re-rendering phase.


* Props:-
-Props stands for properties used to pass data from parent to child component. this is a fundamental concept in react js.

*Hooks:-
-Hooks allows as to use react features in functional component. All this features neatively available in class component. hooks were introduced in react 16.8 version.
Example:- State, ref and life cycle methods etc.   

Usestate
- Usestate is a important hook in react js. use to manage stay in functional component. It takes one state variable and a function to upadate it. it cause re-render on updatation.


* Keys:-
- Keys are special string attribute that you must include when creating lists of elements. They help React efficiently identify which items in  a list have changed, been added, or been removed.

* Fragment:-
- Fragment are a feature in React taht allows you to group multiple elements returned by a component's render method without adding an extra node to the DOM.(emulear Fragment)
